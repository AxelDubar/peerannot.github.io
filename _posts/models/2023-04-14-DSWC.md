## Model

The clustered Dawid and Skene model assumes that the answer is drawn from a multinomial distribution for each worker. This distribution is shared within each cluster.
The likelihood maximized is:

$$
\mathbb{P}(\{y_i^{(j)}\}_{i,j}, \{y_i^\star\}_i|\rho,\pi) = \left[
  \prod_{i\in [n_\text{task}]} \prod_{j\in[n_\text{worker}]} \mathbbb{P}(y_i^{(j)}|y_i^\star,\pi^{(j)})
\right] \left[\mathbb{P}(y_i^\star|\rho)\right]\enspace,
$$
with $\rho_k=\mathbb{P}(y_i^\star=k)$ the prevalence prior and $\pi^{(j)}_{k,\bullet}$ the probabilities of the multinomial distribution for an answer with true label $k$.

## CLI
With `peerannot` in a terminal located in the directory of answers, the clustered DS model can be used as follows (for 3 clusters here).

```bash
peerannnot aggregate . --strategy DSWC[L=3] --answers-file answers.json
```

Note that by default, if the answers are in a file names `answers.json` the `--answers-file` argument can be omitted.

## API

Import the aggregation model in the current session

```python
from peerannot.models import Dawid_Skene_clust as DSWC
```

Assuming the answers are in a dictionary names `answers` then run:

```python
dswc = DSWC(answers, n_workers=n_workers, n_classes=n_classes, L=3)
dswc.run()
yhat = dswc.get_probas()
```
### Estimated abilities

To access the estimated confusion matrices in a variable `pi`, run:

```python
pi = dswc.pi_hat
```


## API details: class models.NaiveSoft
NS model class inherits from `CrowdModel`

---
`__init__(answers, n_classes, L=2, **kwargs)`

Parameters:
- `answers`:*(dict)*
  Dictionary of workers answers with format
```json

            {
                task0: {worker0: label, worker1: label},
                task1: {worker1: label}
            }
```
- `n_classes`: *(int)*
  Number of possible classes
- `L=2`: *(int)*
  Number of clusters for confusion matrices (must be lower or equal than the number of workers)
- `kwargs`: *(dict)*
  Dictionary that can contain `path_remove` to remove tasks identified from the [`WAUM`](/models/WAUM) or another method.
  Must contain the number of workers `n_workers`.


---
`run(epsilon=1e-4, maxiter=100)`

Returns label estimates, confusion matrices, prevalence $\rho$ and number of iterations before the ELBO convergence between two iterates is satisfied.


---
`get_probas()`

Returns the distribution of voted classes from the `baseline`.

---
`get_answers()`

Returns the most voted class from the `baseline`. In case of equalities, a random choice is applied.
