## Identification step

The Weighted Area Under the Margin (WAUM) allows identifying ambiguous tasks in crowdsourced datasets.
Given a neural network classifier $\mathcal{C}$ and a budget $T$ (number of epochs) and a task (image) $x_i$ with labels $\{y_i^{(j)}\}_{j\in\mathcal{A(x_i)}$, the WAUM is defined as:

$$
\mathrm{WAUM}(x_i) := \frac{1}{|\mathcal{A}(x_i)|}\sum_{j\in\mathcal{A}(x_i)} s^{(j)}(x_i)\left\{\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T  \sigma(\mathcal{C}(x_i))_{y_i^{(j)}} - \sigma(\mathcal{C}(x_i))_{[2]}\right\} \enspace.
$$

The weights $s^{(j)}(x_i)$ are defined as the dot-product between the diagonal of the DS confusion matrix and the probabilities output by the classifier.
In a separate file, tasks with WAUM under the quantile $q_\alpha$ are identified as potential ambiguities (with $\alpha\in]0,1[$).
The criterion optimized is the cross-entropy loss.

## CLI
With `peerannot` in a terminal located in the directory of answers, the WAUM identification can be used as follows.
In this example, the classification is for 10 classes, using a pretrained Resnet18 network for $T=50$ epochs. The learning rate of the stochastic gradient descent is set to $0.01$.
The detection quantile is $q_{0.01}$.

```bash
peerannot identify . -s WAUM --n-classes 10 --model resnet18  \
                    --n-epochs=50 --alpha=0.01 --lr=0.01 \
                    --pretrained --optimizer=sgd
```

Note that by default, if the answers are in a file names `answers.json` the `--answers-file` argument can be omitted.
