## Model

The Majority voting model returns the most voted label among the $K$ labels, for each task:

$$
\DeclareMathOperator*{\argmax}{argmax}
\hat y_i = \argmax_{k\in[K]} \sum_{j\in [n_\texttt{worker}]}  \unicode{x1D7D9}_{\{y_i^{(j)}=k\}}.$$

## CLI
With `peerannot` in a terminal located in the directory of answers, the MV model can be used as follows.

```bash
peerannnot aggregate . --strategy MV --answers-file answers.json
```

Note that by default, if the answers are in a file names `answers.json` the `--answers-file` argument can be omitted.

## API

Import the aggregation model in the current session

```python
from peerannot.models import MV
```

Assuming the answers are in a dictionary names `answers` then run:

```python
mv = MV(answers, n_classes)
yhat = mv.get_answers()
```

Note that the majority voting aggregation produces hard labels (Dirac distributions).


## API details: class models.MV
MV model class inherits from `CrowdModel`

---
`__init__(answers, n_classes,**kwargs)`

Parameters:
- `answers`:*(dict)*
  Dictionary of workers answers with format
```json

            {
                task0: {worker0: label, worker1: label},
                task1: {worker1: label}
            }
```
- `n_classes`: *(int)*
  Number of possible classes
- `kwargs`: *(dict)*
  Dictionary that can contain `path_remove` to remove tasks identified from the [`WAUM`](/models/WAUM) or another method.

---
`compute_baseline()`

For each given task, computes the number of votes for each label.

---
`get_answers()`

Returns the most voted class from the `baseline`. In case of equalities, a random choice is applied.
